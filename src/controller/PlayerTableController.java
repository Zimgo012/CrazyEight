 * Date: 2025-02-09
 * Compiler: IntelliJ IDEA
 * Purpose:
 * This project involves developing a software version of the Crazy Eights card game using a standard deck of playing cards.
 * The game will follow the first three variation rules listed on Wikipedia, along with additional custom rules.
 * Understanding these variations is essential for proper implementation.
 * This project is a mandatory requirement for passing the Algonquin CST 8221 â€“ JAP course.
